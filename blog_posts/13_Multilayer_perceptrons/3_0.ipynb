    "Note it is the *direction and not the magnitude of the derivative* that provides ascent / descent direction for the underlying function. To get at the pure direction provided by the derivative we can divide off its magnitude.\n",

    "For a single input function there are only *two* possible direction to choose from \n",

    "Because of this we can normalize the derivative to have unit length by dividing off its norm as $\\frac{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}w}g(w)}{\\left\\Vert \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}w}g(w) \\right\\Vert_2 }$.  The value of this unit-length derivative is either +1 or -1, which makes sense since there are only two directions to move in when our input is one dimensional - left or right - and only one way to move in either direction one *unit* (i.e., $\\pm 1$).  So it is in fact the case that $\\frac{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}w}g(w)}{\\left\\Vert \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}w}g(w) \\right\\Vert_2 } = \\text{sign}(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}w}g(w))$ where $\\text{sign}(\\cdot)$ takes the function taking the arithmetic sign of an input.  \n",

    "Also note as with the single-input case, since we only care about the direction and not the magnitude we can unit-normalize the gradient by dividing by its length as $\\frac{\\nabla g(\\mathbf{w})}{\\Vert \\nabla g(\\mathbf{w}) \\Vert_2 }$, giving the unit-length steepest ascent vector, and $-\\frac{\\nabla g(\\mathbf{w})}{\\Vert \\nabla g(\\mathbf{w}) \\Vert_2 }$ the unit-length steepest descent vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "> At any given input point the (unit-normalized) gradient of a multi-input function provides its direction of steepest *ascent*, in other words the direction in which the gradient tangent hyperplane increases the fastest.  By extension the function itself will - at least locally - increase rapidly in this direction as well.  Likewise the negative (unit-normalized) gradient provides the direction of steepest *descent*, or the direction in which the gradient decreases the fastest, as well as (locally) the function as well."
